# EC601MP2
Deep learning project to differentiate between images of two different types of objects.

# ImageFixer
This python script was used to pull and compress images from my personal collection. There are some gaps in the file numbers due to a few hundred of the pictures being ill suited for this project. I manually deleted them after the batch pull. imagefixer.py does not need to be rerun, but is left in the folder for documentation purposes.
